# Summary
This project is part of the advanced deep learning course at the university of applied science in munich.
During this course we have developed a program that combines image recognition, large language models (LLMs), and diffusion models to provide a seamless integration of AI-based analysis, content generation, and visual creativity.

The program allows you to take a picture of a bottle (won't work or produce gibberish if you don't use a bottle), which will be classified into one of 11 predefined categories.
Once a bottle is classified, the system leverages an LLM to generate a 1,000-word essay detailing the specific characteristics, history, and uses of the identified bottle type. Additionally, the LLM creates prompts for a diffusion model, which then generates unique and visually compelling images tailored to the recognized bottle category.

To streamline output presentation, all generated content, including the essay and images, is processed through a markdown template and compiled into a formatted PDF document.
