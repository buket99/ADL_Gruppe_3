This chapter contains a description of the steps necessary to install and use the system.

## Installation

This section outlines the steps required to install the system, starting with cloning the Git repository and setting up the environment.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

-   Git
-   Python 3.8+ (with pip)
-   An X server (XQuartz on macOS, WSL2 with VcXsrv or X410 on Windows) if you plan to use the GUI.
-   OpenAI API Key

### Step 1: Clone the Git Repository

Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the project repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/buket99/ADL_Gruppe_3.git
cd ADL_Gruppe_3
```

### Step 2: Download the fine-tuned models

Run the following script to download and extract the trained models:

```bash
python download_models.py
```

### Step 3: Set your OpenAI API Key

**Before launching the application**, you need to provide your OpenAI API key.

1. **Create a file named `.env`** inside the `agents` directory.
2. **Open the `.env` file** with a text editor and add your API key in the following format:

    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```

    Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key.
3. **Save the `.env` file.**

Without a valid OpenAI API key in the `agents/.env` file, the article generation functionality will not work.

### Step 4: Install Dependencies

This project can be run directly without Docker. Install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

::: {.callout-note}
It's recommended to create a virtual environment before installing the dependencies to avoid conflicts with other projects.
:::

### Step 5: (Optional) Docker Setup

If you prefer to use Docker, follow these steps:

#### Build the Docker Image

The project can optionally use a Docker container to ensure a consistent environment. Build the Docker image by running the following command in the project's root directory:

```bash
docker build -t adl-gruppe-3 .
```

This command will create a Docker image named `adl-gruppe-3` based on the provided `Dockerfile`. The Dockerfile includes all necessary dependencies, including Pandoc for document conversion.

#### Run the Docker Container (MacOS)

After building the image, run the Docker container with the following command:

```bash
docker run -it --rm --device=/dev/video0:/dev/video0 -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v $(pwd):/app adl-gruppe-3
```

This command does the following:

-   `docker run -it`: Runs a container in interactive mode with a pseudo-TTY.
-   `--rm`: Remove the container when it exits.
-   `--device=/dev/video0:/dev/video0`: Gives the container access to the host's webcam.
-   `-v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw`: Shares the X11 socket, allowing the container to display GUI applications on the host.
-   `-e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY`: Sets the display environment variable.
-   `-v $(pwd):/app`: Mounts the project directory into the container.

::: {.callout-note}
This setup assumes you have a webcam available at `/dev/video0`. If your webcam is at a different path, adjust the command accordingly. For the GUI to work, you need an X server running on your host. On macOS, you might need to install [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/).
:::

#### Run the Docker Container (Windows)

Running the Docker container with webcam access on Windows is more complex due to the lack of direct `/dev/video` support. You'll likely need to use a workaround like a USB/IP solution or explore other methods for accessing the webcam from within the container.

::: {.callout-warning}
The provided Docker setup is primarily tested on macOS. On Windows, you may encounter issues with webcam access and GUI forwarding. Consider running the application directly without Docker on Windows.

## Usage

This section describes the steps required to create an article using the system.

### Step 1: Launch the Application

If you are using Docker, start the container as described in the installation section. If you installed manually, navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal and run:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will launch the application's graphical user interface.

### Step 2: Capture Images

1. **Select a Camera**: Use the "Camera" dropdown menu to select your desired camera. The dropdown will populate with available cameras.
2. **Capture Images**: Click the "Capture" button to take a picture. The captured image will appear in one of the three image slots on the right side of the window. You can capture up to three images.

### Step 3: Select an Image for Evaluation

Click on one of the captured images to select it. The selected image will be highlighted with a blue border.

### Step 4: Evaluate the Image

1. **Choose an Image Classifier**: Use the "Image Classifier" dropdown menu to select the desired classification model (e.g., AlexNet, ResNet50, ViT). The dropdown will display available fine-tuned models.
2. **Evaluate**: Click the "Evaluate Image" button. The system will classify the selected image and display the predicted class (e.g., Water, Wine, Coke) in the feedback label.

### Step 5: Generate the Article

1. **Choose a GPT Model**: Use the "GPT Model" dropdown menu to select the desired GPT model for article generation (e.g., gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4).
2. **Choose a Diffusion Model**: Use the "Diffusion Model" dropdown menu to select the desired model for image generation (e.g., stable-diffusion-v1-5 (mid), stable-diffusion-2-1-base (fast)).
3. **Generate**: Click the "Generate Article" button. The system will generate an article based on the predicted class of the evaluated image, using the selected GPT model. It will also generate images related to the article's topic using the chosen Diffusion Model.
4. **Feedback**: The feedback label will indicate that the article has been generated and passed to the assembler.

### Step 6: Open the PDF

Click the "Open PDF" button to open the generated article in your default PDF viewer. The article will be located at `output.pdf` in the project's root directory.

::: {.callout-note}
The generated PDF will be overwritten each time you generate a new article. If you want to keep a specific version, make sure to save a copy elsewhere.
:::

## Troubleshooting

-   **Camera not found**: Ensure your webcam is properly connected and recognized by your operating system. If you're using Docker on macOS, make sure you've correctly passed the device to the container (e.g., `--device=/dev/video0:/dev/video0`). On Windows running directly without Docker should find the cameras.
-   **GUI not displaying**: If you're using Docker, ensure you've set up X11 forwarding correctly (e.g., `-v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY`). On macOS, install XQuartz. On Windows, use WSL2 with an X server like VcXsrv or X410. If you are running directly on windows, make sure you have an X server installed like VcXsrv or X410.
-   **Article generation fails**: Verify that you've set your OpenAI API key correctly in the `agents/.env` file.
-   **Model not found**: If you encounter errors related to missing models, double-check that you've downloaded the models using `download_models.py` and that they are in the correct directory (`classifiers/model`).
